# Introduction {#sec-intro}

High-speed rail (HSR) has reshaped the spatial organization of cities in China.\
It not only improves intercity accessibility but also influences the **flow of knowledge, capital, and innovation**.

In this paper, we ask: *How has the structure of China’s intercity HSR connectivity network evolved, and what mechanisms drive its formation?*\
As an overview see @fig-example.

# Methods {#sec-methods}

We adopt a **Temporal Exponential Random Graph Model (TERGM)** to capture the dynamics of intercity connectivity networks, following the formulation[@dai2018].

The probability function is given by Eq. @eq-tergm:

$$
P(N^t \mid N^{t-k}, \ldots, N^{t-1}, \theta) 
= \frac{\exp\!\big(\theta^{T}\, h(N^t, N^{t-1}, \ldots, N^{t-k})\big)}
       {c(\theta, N^{t-k}, \ldots, N^{t-1})}
$$ {#eq-tergm}

Where $P(\cdot)$ is the probability that the network $N^t$ is observed at time $t$, $h(\cdot)$ is the vector of network statistics, $\theta^{T}$ are the parameters, and $c(\theta, N^{t-k}, \ldots, N^{t-1})$ is the normalizing constant ensuring that all probabilities sum to 1.

Key elements:\
- **Data source:** train schedules and travel times (2008–2023)\
- **Network construction:** weighted edges based on frequency and shortest travel time\
- **Modeling strategy:** node-level, dyad-level, and endogenous structural effects\
